# Challenge Summary

Breadth-first Traversal.

## Challenge Description

Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency

Recursive approach use a queue and an array

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
