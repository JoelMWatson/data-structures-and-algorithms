# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I decided create a new array, to loop through the array using a for loop setting each element to the opposite point in the reverese array;

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
