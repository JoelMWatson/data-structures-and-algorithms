# Challenge Summary

Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).

#### Stretch Goal:

Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, implement another function that merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

## Background Info

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the LinkedList class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
