## Challenge
Create two classes, Node and LinkedList.
Node
Properties:
    val - The value stored in the Node
    next - A pointer the next Node in the list
    prev - A pointer to the previous Node in the list (for use in stretch goal implementation)
Your Node class does not need to have any functions/methods, though you can add some if you have a use-case for it.
LinkedList
Properties:
    head - The Node that represents the beginning or start of the list
Functions/methods:
    insert() - A function that takes any value as an argument and adds a new Node with that value to the beginning of the list (before the current head
    includes() - A function that takes in a value as an argument and returns true or false if that value was found in the list
    toString() - A function that takes no arguments but prints out a visual representation of the Linked List, similar to the format: { a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL
Note that any errors in your LinkedList class and methods should be well handled and logged. Donâ€™t default to the standard thrown error; instead use try catch blocks to correctly catch errors and log a user-friendly and descriptive message to the console.
Stretch Goal
An optional stretch goal for this lab assignment is to implement a class called DoublyLinkedList. This class should allow users to do all the same functionality of a LinkedList class, except this time each Node will have their next and prev pointers set. How would the insert(), includes() and toString() functions need to be altered to support this?

## Approach & Efficiency
Insert(): O(1)
Includes(): O(n)
toString(): O(n)

## API
insert() - A function that takes any value as an argument and adds a new Node with that value to the beginning of the list (before the current head
includes() - A function that takes in a value as an argument and returns true or false if that value was found in the list
toString() - A function that takes no arguments but prints out a visual representation of the Linked List, similar to the format: { a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL
